Public Repo for Perl Poetry
===========

our $love; for ($perl; $will; not die() ) {} #perlpoetry
---------------------------


###I encourage everyone to submit a Perl poem!  

Add anything you like.  The only rule that matters: 
````
Keep it clean.  Nothing offensive, vulgar, hateful, racist, etc.  Use common sense.  Oh, and please don't plagiarize.
````

I loosly appreciate if it passes a syntax check:  perl -c

````
But it's certainly ok to post a poem about Perl in plain text.
````

I have a soft spot for movie quotes, song lyrics, and pop culture.  Such as,

$bono = not $found =~ /what he is looking for/;
